# challenge for Klikkie

Having a list of N light bulbs(some of them are lit and some are not) and you are allowed to perform exactly M moves. A move consists of turning the light bulb on or off.

### Task 1:

Write an algorithm that finds the longest line that all either are ON or OFF.

### Task 2:

Now when the user switches a bulb ON or OFF, it also switches the one on itâ€™s left (if it exists).

## this repo

run all the algorithms in the challenge on either a generated random number, or a hardcoded string consisting of "0" and "1"

```
node challenge.js
```

run performance benchmarks on both versions of each algorithm

```
node benchmark.js
```
